## Text Summarization <br />

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document. There are broadly two types of text summarization : <br />
1. Extractive Summarisation :  We identify the important sentences or phrases from the original text and extract only those from the text. 
2. Abstractive Summarisation : Here, we generate new sentences from the original text.
