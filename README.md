# Projectified Weeks
This Repository contains a summary of my initiative to drive the AI/ML Community towards effective projects building every month.
I was running a Telegram Group 'Projectified Weeks' with 100+ members motivated towards project based learning. A few projects were finished as well. 
Here's the layout for next six weeks where you can take up one project every week. I have included the datasets and resources as well.
