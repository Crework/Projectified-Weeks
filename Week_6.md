## Question Answering <br />
Question answering (QA) is a well-researched problem in NLP. In spite of being one of the oldest
research areas, QA has application in a wide variety of tasks, such as information retrieval and entity
extraction. Recently, QA has also been used to develop dialog systems and chatbots designed
to simulate human conversation. Traditionally, most of the research in this domain used a pipeline
of conventional linguistically-based NLP techniques, such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging and
coreference resolution. Many of the state-of-the-art QA systems – for example, IBM Watson –
use these methods.

### Datasets
- [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) : Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
- [Natural Questions: a New Corpus and Challenge for Question Answering Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/01/natural-questions-new-corpus-and.html) : NQ is the first dataset to use naturally occurring queries and focus on finding answers by reading an entire page, rather than extracting answers from a short paragraph. 
- [TWEETQA](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1496/) : TWEETQA is a social media-focused question answering dataset.
