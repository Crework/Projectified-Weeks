# Week - 2
## Named Entity Recognition
Named entities are phrases that contain the names of persons, organizations, locations, times and quantities.

### Datasets
- [Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) : The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns language-independent named entity recognition. We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. The participants of the shared task will be offered training and test data for two languages. They will use the data for developing a named-entity recognition system that includes a machine learning component. For each language, additional information (lists of names and non-annotated data) will be supplied as well. The challenge for the participants is to find ways of incorporating this information in their system.
