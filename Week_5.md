## Document Similarity/ Semantic Equivalence <br />

Document similarity (or distance between documents) is a one of the central themes in Information Retrieval. How humans usually define how similar are documents? Usually documents treated as similar if they are semantically close and describe similar concepts. On other hand “similarity” can be used in context of duplicate detection. We will review several common approaches. <br />
[This](http://text2vec.org/similarity.html) is an awesome API that can be used to simplify the task.
